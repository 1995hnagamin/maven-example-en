    <title>Maven by Example</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>The first Maven book was <emphasis>Maven: A Developer’s
      Notebook</emphasis> (O’Reilly). That book introduced Maven in a series
      of steps via a conversation between you and a colleague who already knew
      how to use Maven. The idea behind the (now-retired) Developer’s Notebook
      series was that developers learn best when they are sitting next to
      other developers and going through the same thought processes, learning
      to code by doing and experimenting. Although the series was successful,
      the Notebook format had limitations. Notebooks are, by design,
      “goal-focused” books that take you through a series of steps to achieve
      very specific goals. By contrast, larger reference books (such as
      O’Reilly’s animal books) provide comprehensive reference material that
      cover the entirety of the topic.</para>

      <para>If you read <emphasis>Maven: A Developer’s Notebook</emphasis>,
      you’ll learn how to create a simple project or a project that creates a
      WAR from a set of source files. But if you want to find out the
      specifics for something like the Assembly plugin, you’ll hit an impasse.
      Because there is no well-written reference material for Maven, you have
      to hunt through plugin documentation on the Maven web site or cull from
      a series of mailing lists. Once you really dig into Maven, you end up
      reading through thousands of HTML pages on the Maven site written by
      hundreds of different developers, each with a different idea of what it
      means to document a plugin. Despite the best efforts of well-meaning
      volunteers, reading through plugin documentation on the Maven site is,
      at best, frustrating, and at worst, a reason to abandon Maven. Quite
      often, Maven users get stuck because they just can’t find an
      answer.</para>

      <para>This lack of an authoritative (or definitive) reference manual has
      held Maven back for a few years, and it has been something of a
      dampening force on Maven adoption. With <emphasis>Maven: The Definitive
      Guide,</emphasis> we intend to change that situation by providing a
      comprehensive reference in <xref linkend="part-reference" />. In Part I,
      we’re preserving the narrative progression of a Developer’s Notebook; it
      is valuable material that helps people learn Maven by example. In this
      part, we “introduce by doing,” and in <xref linkend="part-reference" />,
      we fill in the blanks and dig into the details. Where <xref
      linkend="part-reference" /> might use a reference table and a program
      listing detached from an example project, Part I is motivated by real
      examples.</para>

      <para>After reading this part, you should have everything you need to
      start using Maven. You might need to refer to <xref
      linkend="part-reference" /> only when you start customizing Maven by
      writing custom plugins or when you want more detail about specific
      plugins.</para>
